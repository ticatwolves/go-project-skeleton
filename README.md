# ü¶¥ Go Project Template: Skeleton for Modern Modules
This repository is a minimal, opinionated template designed to bootstrap a new Go module. It is pre-configured with industry-standard tooling for code quality, automated testing, and release management.

The value of this skeleton lies in its pre-configured files:

- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- `.github/workflows/go.yml`
- `.config/goreleaser.yaml`
- `go.mod` (ready for renaming)

## Dependencies
This template, uses the following
- [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/)
- [Semantic Versioning](https://github.com/go-semantic-release/semantic-release)
- [pre commit hooks](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks), [pre commit GoLang](https://github.com/dnephin/pre-commit-golang), [pre commit gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks)

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start: Using This Skeleton
Follow these steps to create a new project from this template:

### 1. Clone and Initialize
Replace github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/YOUR_PROJECT_NAME with your actual module path.
```
# 1. Clone the template
git clone [https://github.com/ticatwolves/go-project-skeleton.git](https://github.com/ticatwolves/go-project-skeleton.git) your-new-project-name
cd your-new-project-name

# 2. Delete the template's git history
rm -rf .git

# 3. Initialize your new module path
go mod init [github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/YOUR_PROJECT_NAME](https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/YOUR_PROJECT_NAME)

# 4. Start tracking your new repository
git init
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Initial commit from Go skeleton template"
```

### 2. Setup Local Hooks
We use the `pre-commit` framework to enforce code style locally before committing.

```
# Install framework (requires Python/pip)
pip install pre-commit

# Install hooks into your local git repository
pre-commit install
```

The hooks automatically run gofmt, go vet, and golangci-lint. Configuration details are in .pre-commit-config.yaml.

## üöÄ Automated Release Workflow
This template uses Semantic Versioning (SemVer) and GitHub Actions to automate publishing.

Commit Changes: Commit all your new features/fixes.

Tag the Version: Push a tag to trigger the release workflow.
```
# Example: Creating a new minor version tag
git tag v1.1.0
git push origin v1.1.0
```
This action automatically publishes the module to `pkg.go.dev` and creates a GitHub Release.

## üìö Documentation Best Practices
Documentation is generated by godoc directly from source code comments and is visible on pkg.go.dev.

- Rule: The doc comment must immediately precede the declaration, and the first sentence must start with the identifier.

- Package Overview: Create a doc.go file in the package root for a high-level description.

- Runnable Examples: Create ExampleFunc() functions in your _test.go files to demonstrate usage.
